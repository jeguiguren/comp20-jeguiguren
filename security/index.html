		<h1>Assignment 4</h1>

		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>I was hired as a security consultant to document and resolve the privacy and security issues of a colleague's full stack implementation of a ride-sharing device, trying to exploit its vulnerabilities as much as possible.</p>

		<h2>Methodology</h2>
		<p>In order to perform the mentioned task, I downloaded the POSTMAN App, which provides a user friendly interface to execute HTTP request methods on a given website. Then, I tried a couple of "Black-box" testing, trying to hack my colleague's site without actually looking at the source code. I finally downloaded the documents and took advantage of the notable glitches in the code.</p>

		<h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>
		<p>Overall, the web app fails to verify user input and hide confidential informaiton. 
		Provide an overview of all the security and privacy issues you identified. This section should be written for non-technical managers who do not have technical expertise and do not have time to read the entire document. Write this section using lay language.</p>
