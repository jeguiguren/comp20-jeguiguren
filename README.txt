1. The purpose of this Git repository is to hold all the work and assignments completed for my Web Programming class during the Spring 2018 at Tufts University.

2. My favorite assignment was the ride-sharing platform server-side (assignment 3), as it allowed me to explore how to breach the gap with all that is happening under the hood of what the client sees. 

3. Although I could not dive deep into the Web Programming realms, I have learned the overall workings of the Web and I have learned to contribute as a team member.

4. The most important thing I learned in this course was using code revision control, as it allowed me to track my progress and display my products in a platform.

5. After taking the class, I believe I feel more comfortable understanding the lower-level workings, so I have decided to take Operating Systems next semester.
